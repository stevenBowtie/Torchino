Fix for torch start sequence:
-start each cut with:
  M3        //Start sequence
  G4 P1     //Dwell
  M3        //Re-enable spindle on resume
  Gx Xx Yx  //Run coordinated G-code

Tools > Options > Sender options >
  "Enable single step mode" must be set to prevent errors when the pause signal is sent.
